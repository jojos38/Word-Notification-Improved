# Better Discord Word-Notification-Improved
### A remake of the Word Notification plugin by Qwerasd, it notifies you when certain words are said
### Special thanks to [Aida Enna](https://github.com/Aida-Enna) for fixing bugs, adding some features and pretty much keeping the plugin alive

This plugin is fully configurable.\
You can use Regex as word match, you can have different types of notifications, from Windows notification to in-Discord notification.\

List of options:
- Customizable messages
- Case sensitive -> Should word matching be case sensitive (does not affect Regex)
- Ignore muted servers
- Ignore muted channels
- Ignore private messages
- Ignore blocked users
- Ignore if window is focused and on the channel
- Private message only -> Will only notify words from private messages and ignore all servers
- Ability to blacklist servers and users
- Ability to use a whitelist instead of a blacklist

List of notification options:
- Send Windows notification -> A normal Windows notification
- Windows notification only when not focused -> Windows notification will only be sent if Discord isn't focused
- Send BdApi notification -> A notification which is only on Discord window, on the middle bottom
- Send BDFDB notification -> A notification which is only on Discord window, on the top right
- Ability to configure notification apparition time
